### Compilation
TypingTest uses CMake. Navigate into the build directory. TypingTest supports
in-tree builds. Run `cmake /path/to/source/dir` and `make install`.

### Configuration
You can configure the test settings through the settings menu.

TypingTest supports three major test types and a custom type. The basic test is
a short and quick test using basic words. The advanced test uses less common
words. The endurance test is meant to test your typing for extended periods of
time. The custom test allows you to tweak various settings such as how long the
test should be and what amount of the most common words should be included in
the test.

There are advanced settings as well. Many of these configure how your trouble
words are calculated.
